## Introduction

This is the backend server of the brain training app that handles http requests from the client to register, log-in, customise their profile and add scores to the leader-board.

## Technologies

This repository uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) to run its files.
For our database we use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to store user information online using [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

## Launch

This server communicates with a [front-end](https://github.com/Sigma-Labs-XYZ/brain-training-frontend)
To access this back-and you need to clone the repository and use the command

```
npm install
```

in order to install all of the relevant modules.
You can launch the server on a local-host (8080) using

```
npm start
```

You can run tests using

```
npm test
```
